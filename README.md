# Karaoke DJ Queue App ðŸŽ¤

A simple karaoke song request and queue management tool for karaoke DJs working at bars.

## Problem Statement

As a karaoke DJ, managing song requests is challenging:
- **Paper requests get lost** or become illegible in busy bar environments
- **No visibility for singers** on their position in queue or wait times
- **Manual queue juggling** while trying to entertain the crowd
- **Disputes over queue order** when people can't see the list
- **Inefficient workflow** switching between managing requests and DJ duties

## Solution Overview

A simple web application that makes karaoke DJ work easier:

**For Singers:** Mobile-friendly song request form - just scan QR code, enter name/artist/song, done.

**For DJ:** Clean queue management interface with drag-and-drop reordering and quick YouTube search links.

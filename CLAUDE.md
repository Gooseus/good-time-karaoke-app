# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple karaoke queue management tool for individual karaoke DJs working at bars. The system features a dual-interface design focused on simplicity and convenience:
- **Singer Interface**: HTMX-powered mobile-friendly song request form with singer dropdown
- **DJ Interface**: React-based queue management with drag-and-drop reordering

## Architecture

Simple full-stack web application designed for ease of use:
- **Frontend**:
  - Singer forms: HTMX + server-side HTML (fast, works everywhere)
  - DJ dashboard: React with drag-and-drop (SortableJS)
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server with polling-based updates (no WebSockets)
- **Database**: SQLite (`database-sqlite.js`) with persistent volume storage in production
- **State Management**: XState for session and song state transitions
- **External Integrations**: YouTube search links, QR code generation (domain-aware)

## Implemented Features

### Singer Experience (HTMX + Server-Side)
- **Smart Singer Dropdown**: Shows existing singers from session + "New Singer" option
- **No Signup Required**: Tracks singers across requests without accounts
- **Name Deduplication**: Automatic handling of duplicate names (John â†’ John (2))
- **Mobile Optimized**: Fast-loading forms that work on any device
- **Form Disabling**: Form fades and disables after successful submission
- **Session State Awareness**: Shows pause indicators and respects queue delays
- **Song Management**: Edit/cancel songs after submission
- **Real-time Queue View**: Auto-refreshing queue position display

### DJ Experience (React Dashboard)
- **Touch-Optimized Reordering**: Drag handle + up/down buttons for iPad/touch devices
- **Drag & Drop**: SortableJS with touch support and visual feedback
- **Song State Management**: XState-powered transitions (waiting â†’ playing â†’ done/skipped)
- **Session Pause/Resume**: Control queue state with visual indicators
- **YouTube Integration**: One-click search links for each song
- **Singer Statistics**: Track how many songs each person has requested
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select songs for batch actions
- **Undo System**: Revert last action within 5 minutes
- **Tip Integration**: Venmo, CashApp, Zelle with QR code generation
- **Real-time Updates**: 3-second polling for live queue updates

### Technical Implementation
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3 (`database-sqlite.js`)
- **Production Storage**: Persistent volume at `/data` on Fly.io
- **State Machines**: XState for session (active/paused) and song transitions
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful routes for sessions, songs, singers, state transitions
- **QR Codes**: Domain-aware generation, stored in persistent volume
- **No WebSockets**: Simple polling approach for reliability

## Development Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- Session creation and QR code generation with domain detection
- Singer request form with smart dropdown (HTMX-powered)
- Drag & drop queue management (React + SortableJS)
- YouTube search URL generation
- Singer name deduplication and stats tracking
- Real-time updates via polling (3-second intervals)
- Mobile-optimized interfaces
- Session persistence with JSON file storage

### ðŸ”§ Key Files
- `server.js` - Main Express server with all routes and HTMX templates
- `database-sqlite.js` - SQLite database operations (actively used)
- `database.js` - Legacy JSON storage (kept for reference)
- `src/services/state-manager.js` - XState machines for session/song states
- `public/dj/app.js` - React dashboard with drag-and-drop
- `public/dj/style.css` - DJ dashboard styling with touch optimizations
- `fly.toml` - Fly.io deployment configuration
- `FLY_FIX.md` - Production deployment notes and volume management

## How to Run

### Development
```bash
npm install
PORT=3001 npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3001
```

### Production (Fly.io)
- See `FLY_FIX.md` for deployment and persistence details
- Environment variables: `NODE_ENV=production`, `PORT` (auto-set by Fly)
- Persistent volume: `/data` for SQLite database and QR codes
- Deploy: `fly deploy`
- Single machine configuration prevents data inconsistencies

## API Endpoints

### Core Routes
- `POST /api/sessions` - Create new DJ session
- `GET /api/sessions/:id` - Get session details
- `GET /api/sessions/:id/singers` - Get existing singers list
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/songs` - Submit song request
- `GET /api/sessions/:id/songs` - Get queue and stats

### Management Routes
- `PUT /api/songs/:id/status` - Update song status (waiting/playing/done)
- `PUT /api/songs/:id/position` - Update song position
- `PUT /api/sessions/:id/reorder` - Bulk reorder songs
- `DELETE /api/songs/:id` - Remove song from queue

### User Routes
- `/` - Home page with "Start New Session" button
- `/singer/:sessionId` - Mobile song request form
- `/queue/:sessionId` - Public queue view (auto-refresh)
- `/dj/:sessionId` - DJ dashboard with React interface

## Singer Dropdown Logic

The smart singer dropdown eliminates typing for repeat singers:
1. **First load**: Dropdown shows "Select a singer..." + "ðŸ†• New Singer"
2. **API call**: JavaScript fetches `/api/sessions/:id/singers`
3. **Population**: Existing singers added as dropdown options
4. **Selection**: Choose existing singer OR "New Singer" â†’ show name input
5. **Deduplication**: Only applied to truly new names, existing singers stay consistent
